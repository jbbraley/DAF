The power spectral density was computed for the recorded acceleration of the test truck on its trip to the bridge. The first pole at 2.7 Hz represents the frequency of the first natural mode of vibration.


|Wheel|Weight (lb)|
|---|---|
|Driver-Back|12080|
|Driver-Middle|12180|
|Passenger-Back|12000|
|Passenger-Middle|11680|
|**_Total_**|**_47940_**|

The frequency of single degree of freedom vibration is given by w = sqrt(k/m). The angular frequency of the truck is 2Pi(f)=17.1 rad/sec.
Therefore, the stiffness of the bogie suspension can be approximated by:
k = w^2*m = (17.1)^2*47940/386 = 36316 lb/in.

The stiffness of individual wheel suspensions is simply one quarter of the bogie suspension stiffness (9080 lb/in).

Analysis of other truck acceleration records show a first mode of vibration at 2.6 Hz, corresponding to a stiffness of 33000 lb/in.

the following sprung mass parameters were used
