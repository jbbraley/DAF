## Areas that still require research:

1. Dynamic effects on service limit states. (i.e. cyclic strain in deck causing cracking)
2. Optimize vehicle speed and spacing on multiple lanes via FE
3. Effect of bridge geometry on DAF: 2-span cont.
4. Effect of truck caravans
5. Population FE analysis of traffic dynamic loading
