 The following study aims to quantify the effect of several mechanisms that may
increase the dynamic amplification of bridge response to traffic loading.
These mechanisms include:
Repeated spans providing traffic with specific initial conditions
Bumps before the bridge providing the traffic with initial conditions
Initial conditions of the structure due to previous traffic
Comparable vehicle and structure natural frequencies



Part 1:

The study will look first at 4 simplified single girder models
Single span
2-span continuous
Repeated simple spans
Repeated continuous

The loading scenarios will progress from simple to complex.

1st stage
  Single point mass (unsprung)
  Single sprung mass (undamped)
  Single sprung mass with damping (50%, 100%)

2nd stage
  Random traffic (unsprung)
  Random traffic (undamped)
  Random traffic with damping (50%, 100%)

3rd stage
  bump at beginnning of bridge
  Random traffic with bump between spans (0%, 50%, 100% damping)
  Random traffic with rough surface profile
  dead load deformation as profiles
  inverted dl deformation for over camber


Parameters to evaluate:
  Range of vehicle suspension stiffness
  Structure natural frequencies
  Vehicle spacing
  Bump height
  Vehicle speeds

Part 2:

Additional models will be analyzed
  Multiple spans with mismatched natural frequencies
  Model with softened boundary conditions (i.e. vertical springs)
  3D model with transverse modes (e.g. torsion, butterfly)

Loading scenarios will include
  Traffic with various damping
  Traffic with bump and surface roughness profiles
  Truck train
